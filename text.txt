      keyPoint: "Don't eat eggs. Don't worry this recipe for mango cake has got you covered..IT'S EGGLESS. The milk vinegar mixture provides the softness as well as moisture to the cake. However, As I always suggest, cover and cool the cake after baking for 5-10 mins and then tightly wrap the cake with cling film and let the cake cool for sponge like texture.Do give this cake a try  for the delicious Mango ExtragavanzaðŸ¥­ðŸ¥­"  ,
